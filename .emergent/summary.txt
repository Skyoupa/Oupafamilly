The AI engineer's work trajectory outlines the development of the Oupafamilly application, starting from a GitHub repository clone to building out a complex tutorial system. The process began with setting up the React frontend and FastAPI backend, including dependency installation and service management via Supervisor. A significant portion of the work focused on the Tutoriels (Tutorials) feature. Initially, the frontend displayed static tutorial data, which the engineer corrected to fetch dynamic content from the backend API. Subsequent iterations involved resolving issues with tutorial detail page navigation, ensuring local image loading, and implementing visual enhancements like colored difficulty badges. The engineer also began expanding the tutorial content to meet user requirements for increased quantity per game, French translation, and unique imagery, demonstrating a methodical approach to feature development and bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
The initial request was to download and replace the existing codebase with the Oupafamilly GitHub repository. Subsequently, the primary focus shifted to enhancing the tutorial system. The user explicitly requested to:
1.  **Populate tutorial content**: Fill tutorials professionally, adapting content to difficulty levels, ensuring accuracy from multiple sources, and incorporating images and links.
2.  **Database integration for tutorials**: Store tutorial content in a database.
3.  **UI/UX correspondence**: Ensure the interface matches the tutorial's experience.
4.  **Difficulty level display**: Color-code tutorial difficulty levels (Beginner: Green, Intermediate: Yellow, Expert: Red).
5.  **Image management**: Resolve image loading issues in previews and detail views, download images locally, and store them for easier display. Each tutorial image should be unique and relevant to the game.
6.  **Content Expansion**: Increase the number of tutorials to 12 per game (initially for CS2, WoW, then LoL, SC2, Minecraft).
7.  **Localization**: Translate all tutorial content into French, retaining only game-specific terms in English.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Environment Management**:  for configuration (REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL, MONGO_URL), Supervisor for background service management.
-   **API Design**: Backend API endpoints prefixed with , handling data retrieval and user authentication (JWT).
-   **Data Persistence**: MongoDB for storing dynamic content (tutorials, users).
-   **Frontend State Management**: React  and  for data fetching and rendering.
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for UI styling, including dynamic class application.
-   **Content Management**: Markdown rendering for tutorial content, image handling with local storage.
-   **Scripting**: Python scripts for database population, image download, and content updates.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack structure with dedicated backend and frontend directories.



-   : The core FastAPI application. It's important for defining the main application instance, CORS settings, and including various API routes. No direct changes were mentioned apart from confirming its setup.
-   : This file defines the API endpoints for fetching and managing tutorials.
    -   **Changes**: Initially, it likely had a default limit on the number of tutorials returned. This limit was increased (e.g., ) to ensure all generated tutorials are fetched by the frontend.
-   : The main React component that handles client-side routing.
    -   **Changes**: The routing for tutorial details was corrected from  to  to match the intended deep linking structure.
-   : This component displays the list of available tutorials.
    -   **Changes**: This file underwent significant modifications. Initially, it used hardcoded static tutorial data. It was rewritten to fetch tutorial data dynamically from the backend API. Also, logic was added to correctly format the link to  using  and . It was further updated to correctly apply CSS classes for difficulty levels (, , ) by ensuring the original English level string was retained for class application, while the displayed text was translated to French. Image rendering logic was also improved, including a fallback.
-   : Displays the detailed content of a specific tutorial.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to correctly parse  and  (derived from slug) from the URL parameters to fetch and display the relevant tutorial from the database.
-   : Global CSS file for the frontend.
    -   **Changes**: Custom CSS rules were added for the difficulty badges (green for beginner, yellow for intermediate, red for expert) to visually distinguish tutorials by their level.
-   : This directory was created (or used) to store locally downloaded tutorial images, ensuring reliable image loading.
-   **Temporary Scripts**: Multiple Python scripts were created to automate database population, image downloading, and tutorial content updates/corrections. These include , , , , , , and . These scripts were crucial for data migration and content generation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the remaining tutorials for League of Legends (7 more needed to reach 12).
-   Create 12 tutorials for StarCraft II.
-   Create 12 tutorials for Minecraft.
-   Ensure all newly added and existing tutorial content is translated into French (only game terms in English).
-   Assign unique and relevant images to each new tutorial.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on expanding the tutorial system to meet the target of 12 tutorials per game, ensuring all content is translated into French, and unique, relevant images are assigned.

The engineer had already:
1.  **Gathered content** for League of Legends, StarCraft II, and Minecraft.
2.  **Downloaded new specific images** for these games.
3.  **Created **: This script was executed to add missing tutorials and translate content for CS2 and WoW, bringing the total count to 27 tutorials across CS2 (12), WoW (12), and LoL (3). This script successfully added tutorials and initiated the French translation for existing ones.
4.  **Created **: This script was created, indicating the next step to specifically address the Minecraft tutorials.

The current state is that CS2 and WoW games now have 12 professional tutorials each, classified by difficulty and with images and colors working correctly. League of Legends has 3 tutorials. StarCraft II and Minecraft tutorials are still pending their full expansion to 12. The immediate task is to process the  script.

<optional_next_step>
Finalize the tutorial content and image integration for Minecraft and then proceed to StarCraft II and remaining League of Legends tutorials.
