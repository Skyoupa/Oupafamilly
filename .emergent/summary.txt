<analysis>
The AI engineer's trajectory chronicles the iterative development of the Oupafamilly tutorial application. It started with setting up the full-stack React and FastAPI environment. The core effort revolved around building a robust tutorial system, initially focusing on fetching dynamic tutorial data and correcting navigation. Subsequent work addressed critical user feedback: implementing colored difficulty badges, ensuring local and relevant image loading, expanding content to 12 tutorials per game, and comprehensive French translation, including specific AZERTY keyboard references. The engineer diligently refined content quality using  as a reference, integrated dedicated hubs for resources and AI recommendations, and streamlined the UI by removing skill trees and AI recommendations per user requests. The iterative process involved creating numerous Python scripts for data management and making direct modifications to frontend and backend code, demonstrating a systematic approach to feature development and bug resolution.

<product_requirements>
The Oupafamilly application aims to provide a professional, interactive tutorial system for various esports games. The user's primary goal is to have highly detailed, accurate, and localized tutorial content. Key requirements include:
1.  **Professional Tutorial Content**: Tutorials must be professionally written, adapted to difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert), accurate (using sources like Liquipedia), and include relevant routines and resources. Content should be 100% in French, with only game-specific terms in English.
2.  **Database Integration**: All tutorial content, including details, images, and links, must be stored in a MongoDB database.
3.  **UI/UX**: The interface should be intuitive, visually appealing, and support the tutorial experience. Specific UI elements requested:
    *   **Difficulty Display**: Color-coded badges (Green for Beginner, Yellow for Intermediate, Red for Expert).
    *   **Image Management**: Unique, game-specific, and high-quality images for each tutorial, stored locally.
    *   **Content Hubs**: Dedicated sections for Ressources Utiles (Useful Resources) with clickable links and Recommandation IA (AI Recommendations) should be placed in specific UI hubs, not within tutorial content.
    *   **Clavier AZERTY Support**: Tutorial content that mentions keyboard inputs must be adapted for AZERTY layout (e.g., 'Z' for forward movement).
    *   **UI Simplification**: Remove the skill tree and AI recommendations from the main tutorial display to declutter the interface, but maintain the hubs for resources and AI recommendations.
4.  **Content Expansion**: A target of 12 tutorials per game (CS2, WoW, LoL, SC2, Minecraft).
5.  **Localization**: All tutorial content (titles, descriptions, markdown) must be translated into French.
6.  **Deployability**: The application should be deployable on standard hosting providers like OVH.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Environment Management**:  for configuration, Supervisor for service management.
-   **API Design**: Backend API endpoints prefixed with .
-   **Data Persistence**: MongoDB for storing dynamic content.
-   **Frontend State Management**: React  and .
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for UI, dynamic class application.
-   **Content Management**: Markdown rendering, image handling.
-   **Scripting**: Python scripts for data population, updates, and image processing.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup with distinct backend and frontend components.



-   : Defines API endpoints for tutorials.
    -   **Changes**: The tutorial fetch limit was increased from 20 to 100. Sorting logic was added to support ordering by difficulty (beginner, intermediate, expert).
-   : Main React component for routing.
    -   **Changes**: Routing for tutorial details () was corrected.
-   : Displays the list of tutorials.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to fetch dynamic data, format links, apply CSS for difficulty, and improved image rendering. The  in the frontend fetch was corrected from 50 to 100.
-   : Displays detailed tutorial content.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to parse URL parameters. Significant changes were made to integrate  and . The  (skill tree) component and its import were removed. The  import and usage were also removed.
-   : Global styles.
    -   **Changes**: Custom CSS for difficulty badges (green, yellow, red).
-    (New): Created to house clickable external links for useful resources.
-    (New): Created to house AI-driven tutorial recommendations.
-   : Used for storing locally downloaded and base64-encoded tutorial images.
-   **Numerous Python Scripts**: A series of Python scripts (e.g., , , , , ) were created and executed to populate, update, translate, enrich, and correct tutorial data, images, and content language/layout (AZERTY).
-   **Deployment Scripts**:  and  were created, along with , to outline and prepare for OVH deployment.

<pending_tasks>
-   No explicit pending tasks were left by the previous AI engineer at the end of the trajectory; the last message was a new request from the user.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just completed a significant round of updates to the Oupafamily tutorial application. The last confirmed state was that the system achieved perfection absolue with:
1.  **Official Images**: All tutorial images for CS2, LoL, SC2, WoW, and Minecraft were replaced with specific official images provided by the user (e.g., PCGamesN for CS2, JeuxVideo.com for LoL). These images are now integrated and display correctly.
2.  **100% French Content + AZERTY**: All tutorial content, including markdown, was fully translated into professional French. Specific keyboard configurations like AZERTY ( for forward movement) were also integrated into the textual explanations.
3.  **UI Simplification**: The skill tree (GamificationPanel) and AI Recommendations (AIRecommendationsHub) components were successfully removed from the main tutorial detail page to streamline the user interface, as per user requests. However, the plan was to keep the AI recommendations in a separate hub to the right, which seems to have been removed in the final step.
4.  **Professional Content**: The tutorials were thoroughly re-evaluated and rewritten to be truly professional, incorporating reliable information from sources like Liquipedia (though explicit mention of Liquipedia was to be removed from the site) and including concrete training routines, real resources with links (to be moved to a dedicated hub), and relevant AI recommendations (to be moved to a dedicated hub).
5.  **Deployability**: Initial steps were taken to optimize the application for OVH deployment, including creating a script () and documentation ().

The immediate interaction before the summary request indicates the user is still not fully satisfied with the content quality and structure of resources/AI, and also notes that links in the resource hub are not clickable.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Fix the clickable links in the resources hub and ensure all tutorials are truly professional and entirely in French.
