The AI engineer's trajectory reveals an iterative development process. It began by resolving a specific content localization issue in the Économie CS2 tutorial, which involved database debugging due to an incorrect database name. Following this, the focus shifted entirely to expanding community features. This phase introduced virtual currency, a marketplace, betting, and a messaging system, initially on a new frontend page. Upon user feedback, the engineer adeptly refactored these new features into the existing community page, preserving its original design. The current work is centered on debugging the member profile pages, specifically addressing runtime errors upon clicking profiles and ensuring member data correctly displays on the frontend, highlighting a persistent challenge in frontend data synchronization and rendering.

The Oupafamilly application aims to be a professional, interactive esports tutorial system. Initially, it required high-quality, 100% French tutorials (e.g., CS2, WoW, LoL, SC2, Minecraft) with specific difficulty badges, unique images, AZERTY keyboard adaptation, and external resource/AI recommendation hubs. Content must be stored in MongoDB.

The user later expanded requirements to a comprehensive community platform:
1.  **Community Features**: Implement a professional community space.
2.  **Profile Enhancements**: Enable comments on player/team profiles with owner deletion.
3.  **Communication**: Replace the public chat system with a private messaging (mail) system between members. The messaging interface should be modern, with search capabilities, scrollable lists, and high contrast.
4.  **Monetary System**: Introduce a virtual currency system.
5.  **Marketplace**: Integrate a marketplace for virtual goods, powered by the currency system.
6.  **Betting System**: Implement a betting system based on tournaments, integrated with the currency.
7.  **Experience System**: Develop an experience (XP) system for members based on tournament participation (win/lose).
8.  **Data Preservation**: Ensure existing member and team data is preserved and enhanced, not overwritten.
9.  **UI/UX Integration**: Integrate all new features cleanly into the existing  page, maintaining its original design and professional aesthetic.
10. **Deployment**: Application must remain optimized for OVH.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture**: React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
-   **Environment Management**:  for configuration, Supervisor for service management, Kubernetes ingress.
-   **Data Persistence**: MongoDB for dynamic content (tutorials, users, teams, currency, comments, chat, betting).
-   **Frontend**: React component-based development, / hooks, Tailwind CSS, markdown rendering,  for environment variables.
-   **Backend**: FastAPI for API endpoints, Pydantic models for data validation, Python for scripting.
-   **Scripting**: Python scripts for data initialization, population, and updates.
-   **Authentication**: JWT for secure API access.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a standard full-stack setup with distinct backend and frontend components. The backend is FastAPI, and the frontend is React. Communication between them occurs via the , with all backend API routes prefixed with  for Kubernetes ingress. MongoDB serves as the database, accessed by the backend via  and .



**Key File Summaries and Changes:**

*   : Defines data models. **Summary**: Expanded to include  fields for , , , , , , and new models for , , , , , .
*   : Main FastAPI app. **Summary**: Updated to include new API routers from , , , and , and added WebSocket authentication logic.
*    (NEW): Manages virtual currency. **Summary**: Implemented endpoints for daily bonus, getting user coins, and currency transactions.
*    (NEW): Manages profile comments. **Summary**: Implemented endpoints for adding, fetching, and deleting comments on user profiles.
*    (NEW): Manages chat messages. **Summary**: Implemented endpoints for real-time chat, including sending and fetching messages. *Note: This was later deprecated in favor of a messaging system.*
*    (NEW): Manages betting. **Summary**: Implemented endpoints for creating betting markets, placing bets, and managing user bets.
*   : Main React component. **Summary**: Updated to remove the temporary  route and include the new  route for detailed member profiles. Ensures all community features route to . Corrected  access.
*    (MODIFIED): The primary community page. **Summary**: Extensively refactored to integrate new tabs for Marketplace, Messaging, and Betting. Contains logic for displaying user stats (coins, XP), managing daily bonuses, listing members, and handling the new messaging and betting UIs. Initially had a  redeclaration error that was fixed.
*    (NEW): Dedicated member profile page. **Summary**: Created to display detailed user information and integrate the comment system. Currently undergoing debugging for data loading and runtime errors.
*    &  (MODIFIED/NEW): Stylesheets. **Summary**: Added extensive CSS for the new community features, including modern messaging design (high contrast, search bar), marketplace styling, betting interface, and profile page layout.
*    (NEW): Script to correct the Économie CS2 tutorial content. **Summary**: Connects to MongoDB, retrieves the specific tutorial, and updates its markdown content to be entirely in French, removing English phrases.
*    (NEW): Script to populate initial community data. **Summary**: Creates initial marketplace items, updates existing user profiles with default currency and XP fields.
*    (NEW): Script to populate initial betting data. **Summary**: Creates test tournaments and matches for the betting system.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Debug Member Profile Display**: Fix the  when clicking on a member profile, and ensure members are correctly displayed on the  page's member list (as they are currently not showing).
-   **Refactor Remaining CS2 Tutorials**: Continue updating the remaining CS2 tutorials to be fully professional, incorporate Tier 1 strategies and Vitality inspiration, and ensure all content, including markdown, is entirely in French (this task was initially pending and not touched upon in this trajectory, as attention shifted to community features).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively engaged in debugging the frontend  page. The user reported Uncaught runtime errors when clicking on a member's profile from the  page, and also noted that members were not appearing in the community page's member list.

The engineer identified that the  component was likely causing the errors, specifically suspecting issues with how user data ( variable) was being accessed or defined, possibly related to an uninitialized  hook or similar context. Several attempts were made to fix linting errors within  related to the  variable being undefined (e.g., in functions determining comment deletion permissions or displaying user-specific content).

The engineer then simplified the  component to ensure it would work with existing API endpoints, aiming to resolve the runtime errors. After applying these changes and restarting the backend, a frontend screenshot was taken of the  page. The screenshot revealed that while the main community page loaded, the members list was empty, indicating a persistent issue with data retrieval or rendering of members, which also prevents testing the clickable profile links. The current work ended with the engineer acknowledging the members not showing issue and preparing to debug the profile page directly to understand why data isn't loading.
